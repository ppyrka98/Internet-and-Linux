##How to navigate the directory structure
The $ sign means you are logged into your Linux server and at the command prompt.
From this point, you can simply type in the command and press enter.
This are some basic navigating commands
$ pwd - Use this command to find out where you are in the directory structure. When you log on to Linux, your starting
        directory is always your home directory, so you'll be in /home/[your username] as any other user than root, or
        /root if you're logged in as root. But, this is useful if you lose track.
$ cd[directory] - This is used to change the current directory.
$ cd.. - you'll be moved up one directory, so you'll now be in the /home directory.  Repeat the command, and you'll be
         in the root (/) directory.
$ cd/etc - This will move the current directory to the /etc directory in one step
$ cd/home/[username] - This moves you back in the directory
$ cd../../ - Also used to move back in the directory
$ cd- - Moves to the previous working directory
$ cd  - Using cd without an argument moves the working directory straight to the user's home directory.
$ ls - This is the list command, so that you can view the contents of a directory including all files and subdirectories
$ ls/home/[username] - In this case, the directory specified has its contents listed.  The directory reference
                       can be absolute or relative.
