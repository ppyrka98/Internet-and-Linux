####How to Read a Web Address
- Example of web address : https://google.com

  components that have a specific meaning to them. the "https://" is the internet protocol for the URL that is required to reach
  the online source. The "google" part of it would be the domain name of the server where the desired information you want is located. 
  The final part of the address ".com" represents the top-level domain, which identifies the website's purpose.
  - For further detail, the "www." would be sub domain, "google" would be the second-level domain, and ".com" the top-level domain.
